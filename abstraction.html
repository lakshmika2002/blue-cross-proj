        The Blue Cross of India (BCI) is an animal welfare charity based in Chennai, India. It was established in 1959 by Captain V. Sundaram, his wife Usha and their three children, in Chennai (then Madras). The society was formally registered in 1964 under the Societies Registration Act. The nine signatories to the Articles and Memorandum of Association were Captain V. Sundaram, Usha Sundaram, S. Chinny Krishna, Suresh Sundaram, S. Vijayalakshmi, D. Daivasigamony, Kamakshi Krishnamoorthi, Sundari Nataraj and T. V. Chandrasekhar. It is now one of the country's largest animal welfare organisations. It runs several animal welfare programs including animal rights awareness.

The non-medical division of the organisation is looked after by volunteers. The organisation has received several national and international awards.

On July 27, 1994, thirty years after the organisation's founding, it received a gift of 4 acres (16,000 m2) of land and a donation of â‚¹ 25,00,000. This land was purchased a few months later so that they could have a permanent shelter.
